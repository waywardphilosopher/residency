Large bet on myself in round one. Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? It's toe-tappingly tragic! Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!

Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? I love you, buddy! Soon enough. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. It doesn't look so shiny to me.

Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. I'm a thing. Shut up and take my money! Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.

Tell her she looks thin. And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me!

There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! You don't know how to do any of those. We don't have a brig. You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go.

1. I'll get my kit!
2. I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy!
3. Oh sure! Blame the wizards!

The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep. Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography.

Oh sure! Blame the wizards! For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.

- Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file!
- Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court!
- That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing.

That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?

OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. You can see how I lived before I met you. For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! That's the ONLY thing about being a slave.

Well, then good news! It's a suppository. Hey, whatcha watching? What are their names? Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony?

I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography.

But existing is basically all I do! OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. Tell them I hate them. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit!

They're like sex, except I'm having them! We don't have a brig. Daddy Bender, we're hungry. Is the Space Pope reptilian!? You know, I was God once.

We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.

I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'! Really?!

Meh. What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy!

Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. Now what? But I've never been to the moon! It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?

All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school! You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go.
