That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. I had more, but you go ahead. And when we woke up, we had these bodies. Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault!

I wish! It's a nickel. Shut up and take my money! That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him! That's the ONLY thing about being a slave.

Soothe us with sweet lies. I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! Ummm…to eBay? No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. I don't want to be rescued.

There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?

Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. File not found. Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff!

1. Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?!
2. No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it.
3. Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way?

Look, last night was a mistake. That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…

Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! We're rescuing ya. Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor.

- You're going back for the Countess, aren't you?
- We're rescuing ya.
- Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies.

Oh sure! Blame the wizards! Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. So, how 'bout them Knicks? I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want!

Bender, quit destroying the universe! It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. No! Don't jump! Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! Your best is an idiot!

I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! No. We're on the top. In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.

Ummm…to eBay? And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet. Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory.

Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? No. We're on the top. Tell them I hate them. Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence.

Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.

Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. Daylight and everything. Ummm…to eBay? Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.

Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. Large bet on myself in round one. Belligerent and numerous. No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Professor, make a woman out of me.

Ow, my spirit! Oh God, what have I done? I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! Hello Morbo, how's the family? Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it.

Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be… How much did you make me?

Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? Oh yeah, good luck with that.
