Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?

Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be… Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault!

That's not soon enough! These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. I wish! It's a nickel. Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments."

But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.

Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. You know, I was God once. Anyone who laughs is a communist! Why did you bring us here?

1. Tell them I hate them.
2. Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun!
3. Oh right. I forgot about the battle.

Hey, whatcha watching? Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head."

Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. I just told you! You've killed me! You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? I don't want to be rescued. Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'?

- You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM!
- But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.
- Anyone who laughs is a communist!

Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! Guess again. I don't want to be rescued. Oh yeah, good luck with that. But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.

It's a T. It goes "tuh". I just told you! You've killed me! Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. Moving along… Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony?

Who am I making this out to? No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.

Who are those horrible orange men? For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. You mean while I'm sleeping in it? Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial?

I wish! It's a nickel. With gusto. Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day.

All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school! Bite my shiny metal ass. Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. And I'm his friend Jesus.

Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! It's a T. It goes "tuh". And when we woke up, we had these bodies. You mean while I'm sleeping in it?

Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! You wouldn't. Ask anyway! I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him!

No! Don't jump! Oh yeah, good luck with that. That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it? And until then, I can never die?

For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! Why yes! Thanks for noticing. There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep.

Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?
